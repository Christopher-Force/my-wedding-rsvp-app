# Wedding RSVP App

Welcome to the repository for my custom Wedding RSVP App! I created this app for my own wedding last year, aiming to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for our guests as they RSVP'd to our special day. Developed using Tailwind CSS, React, and HTML, this app showcases my dedication to both my personal life and my development skills.

In this custom Wedding RSVP App, I integrated two convenient options for our guests to support our journey together. I designed the platform to offer both an Amazon Registry and an option to contribute towards our Honeymoon Fund.
